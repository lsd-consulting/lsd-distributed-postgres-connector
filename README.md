## About

This is a PostgreSQL version of the data connector for the distributed data storage.

## Modes

To cater for various usage scenarios, the connector can be initialised in two modes based on the values of
the `failOnConnectionError` parameter:

- false - if the connector fails to connect on start up, it will silently swallow the exception and set the connector to
  the `inactive` mode.
  This means all queries for storing interactions will be ignored. This is the default behaviour and should be used when
  the main role of the connector is to capture interactions.
- true - if the connector fails to connect on start up, it will throw an exception preventing the startup of the
  application.
  This is a useful mode for applications that rely on the connector for their critical functionality, eg.
  the `lsd-dostributed-generator-ui`.

## Connection
The connector accepts a connection string as the value of the `lsd.dist.connectionString` property from the `lsd-distributed-connector` library.
For example:
```properties
lsd.dist.connectionString=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/lsd_database?user=sa&password=sa&useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8
```

However, if the connection requires a more complicated setup, the connector is able to pick up a `DataSource` bean. 
In this case the above property needs to be set to `dataSource`. For example:
```properties
lsd.dist.connectionString=dataSource
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/lsd_database?user=sa&password=sa&useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8
```

## Properties

The following properties can be overridden by setting a System property.

| Property Name                        | Default | Description                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| lsd.dist.db.failOnConnectionError    | false   | See [Modes](#Modes) for details.                                                 |
| lsd.dist.db.traceIdMaxLength         | 32      | To prevent insertion issues the trace id will be trimmed to this length          |
| lsd.dist.db.bodyMaxLength            | 10000   | To prevent insertion issues the body will be trimmed to this length              |
| lsd.dist.db.requestHeadersMaxLength  | 10000   | To prevent insertion issues the request headers will be trimmed to this length   |
| lsd.dist.db.responseHeadersMaxLength | 10000   | To prevent insertion issues the response headers will be trimmed to this length  |
| lsd.dist.db.serviceNameMaxLength     | 200     | To prevent insertion issues the service name will be trimmed to this length      |
| lsd.dist.db.targetMaxLength          | 200     | To prevent insertion issues the target name will be trimmed to this length       |
| lsd.dist.db.pathMaxLength            | 200     | To prevent insertion issues the path will be trimmed to this length              |
| lsd.dist.db.httpStatusMaxLength      | 35      | To prevent insertion issues the HTTP status value will be trimmed to this length |
| lsd.dist.db.httpMethodMaxLength      | 7       | To prevent insertion issues the HTTP method will be trimmed to this length       |
| lsd.dist.db.profileMaxLength         | 20      | To prevent insertion issues the profile name will be trimmed to this length      |

NOTE
Make sure that the above `maxLength` values are not set greater than the values in the [prepareDatabase.sql](src/main/resources/db/prepareDatabase.sql) script.
